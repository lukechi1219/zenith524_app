# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Flutter application called "zenith524_app" (專注力大師 - Focus Master), a Pomodoro timer productivity app. The repository currently contains documentation, blog content, and project planning materials, but the Flutter source code is not yet present.

### Core Features (Planned)
- Pomodoro timer with 25-minute focus sessions + 5-minute breaks
- Two timer modes: countdown and count-up
- Data analytics and insights for productivity tracking  
- Gamification elements (XP, achievements, streaks)
- Smart notification system
- Team/enterprise features for shared timers and insights

### Target Users
- Students for study sessions and exam preparation
- Office workers for deep work and project management
- Parents for time management and focused family time
- Freelancers for client project tracking and self-discipline

## Repository Structure

Currently this is a documentation repository with:
- `docs/` - Contains 15 blog posts about productivity and Pomodoro techniques
- `docs/index.md` - Main app description and marketing content (Traditional Chinese)
- `privacy-policy.md` and `privacy-policy_zh_Hant_TW.md` - Privacy policies
- `README.md` - Project milestones and todo items (Traditional Chinese)

## Language and Localization

The project is primarily in Traditional Chinese (zh_Hant_TW), targeting Taiwanese users. All documentation, UI text, and user-facing content should maintain this localization.

## Development Status

This repository appears to be in the planning/documentation phase. When Flutter development begins, expect standard Flutter project structure:
- `lib/` for Dart source code
- `test/` for unit and widget tests  
- `pubspec.yaml` for dependencies
- `android/` and `ios/` platform-specific code

## Key Business Logic Areas (Planned)

Based on README.md requirements:
1. **Timer Management** - Countdown and count-up timer modes
2. **Data Analytics** - Session tracking and productivity insights 
3. **Team Features** - Sharing timers and target times between users
4. **Monetization** - Insights as paid feature, enterprise version planned

## Content Management

The `docs/` directory contains a series of blog posts numbered 01-15 covering various productivity topics. These serve as content marketing for the app and should be maintained for SEO and user education purposes.
